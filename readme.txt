This plugin adds the featured image icon to the postlist.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the featured image icon to the post and pageslist. Makes it easier to keep the photo's of the mushrooms appart..;-)
Actually I was supprised I couldn't find this function as a plugin yet. Maybe I just didn't look well enough. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. go to your postlist or pagelist and enjoy

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you write this widget? =
I run a photoblog where posts are 99% for posting images through the featured image feature. 

= I want only posts/pages to show the featured images =
Yes, that can happen to the best.. Go to the screenoption in the top of the pages or posts screen, open and remove the x in the featured image
option. It's not always about userinterfaces and difficult sollutions..;)

Why only the posts and not the pages? Yep.. you're right.. so that's what's added. The pages show their featured image now too.

Whoever made the svn folder at Wordpress named the plugin image-to-postlist
